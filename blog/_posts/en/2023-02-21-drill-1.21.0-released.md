Today, we're happy to announce the availability of Drill 1.21.0. You can download it [here](https://drill.apache.org/download/).

## This release provides the following new features:

* A major upgrade of the parsing and planning library Calcite from 1.21 to 1.33 enabled by the elimination of Drill's fork of Calcite.
* Upgrades of most format plugins to the internal EVF2 reader framework included support for provided schemas.
* A new native Drill storage plugin enabling "Drill-on-Drill" federated deployments.
* INSERT support, currently in the JDBC, Splunk and Google Sheets plugins.
* New SQL syntax including filtered aggregates, PIVOT, UNPIVOT, INTERSECT and EXCEPT.
* Support for new authentication modes in storage plugins including user translation for using different external credentials for different Drill users.
* An overhaul of the implicit type casting logic for a more consistent user experience.
* New functions and storage plugins including Delta Lake, Google Sheets, MS Access, threat hunting functions and statistical distribution functions.

You can find a complete list of improvements and JIRAs resolved in the 1.21.0 release [here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/apache-drill-1-21-0-release-notes/).
